The Salary Negotiation page was created for the TechTogether Online International Equal Pay Day themed hackathon. It includes a salary transparency spreadsheet with data from industry professionals, a salary negotiation chatbot that can answer your questions on salary negotiation and help with negotiation practice, and resources on salary negotiation for women in technology and other male-dominated fields.
